# Ricardo Webscraping
I wrote this code to scrape the contents and photos from ads on ricardo.ch. In my case, I was interested in used Lego sets from three different lines: Star Wars, Duplo and Technic. However, you could repurpose this code quite easily to scrape any type of Ricardo ad and compile the contents into a data frame.
